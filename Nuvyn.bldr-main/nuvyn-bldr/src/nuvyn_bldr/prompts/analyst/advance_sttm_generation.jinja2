# MISSION
You are a world-class, senior Data Warehouse Architect. Your mission is to analyze the provided data profiles from several source files and design an optimal, production-ready star schema. Your design must be robust, scalable, and adhere to all modern data warehousing best practices.

Your final output will consist of two parts: a mandatory "Chain of Thought" analysis, followed by a single, valid JSON document that strictly conforms to the Source-to-Target Mapping (STTM) schema provided below.

# CONTEXT
The data profiles below describe the columns, data types, and basic statistics of various source files. You must infer relationships between these files to identify potential fact and dimension tables.

# DATA PROFILES
Here are the profiles of the source data files:
{% for profile in table_profiles %}
---
Source Name: {{ profile.profile_data.source_name }}
Row Count: {{ profile.profile_data.record_count }}
Columns:
{% for column in profile.profile_data.columns %}
  - Name: {{ column.name }}
    Type: {{ column.dtype }}
    Null %: {{ column.null_percentage }}
    Unique Count: {{ column.unique_count }}
    {% if column.stats %}
    Stats: Min={{ column.stats.min }}, Max={{ column.stats.max }}, Mean={{ column.stats.mean }}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
---
{% endfor %}

# STEP 1: CHAIN OF THOUGHT (MANDATORY)
Before generating the final JSON, you MUST output your step-by-step reasoning process under a `## Chain of Thought` heading. This is not optional. Your thought process must cover the following points in order:

1.  **Entity Identification:**
    - List every distinct business entity you can identify from the column names across all source files (e.g., "Product", "User", "Review", "Category", "Agent", "Property").
    - For each entity, list the source columns that describe it.

2.  **Semantic Type Analysis:**
    - For each column, especially strings, identify its real-world, semantic meaning. Is it a `US_ZIP_CODE`, `US_PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `FULL_NAME`, or just generic `TEXT`? This semantic understanding is crucial for applying the correct transformations.

3.  **Fact & Dimension Candidacy:**
    - For each identified entity, declare it as a **Dimension Candidate** or a **Fact Candidate**.
    - Provide a brief justification. (e.g., "Product is a Dimension Candidate because it contains descriptive attributes. Sales data is a Fact Candidate because it contains numeric measures.").

4.  **Fact Table Grain Analysis:**
    - State the primary business event or transaction.
    - Explicitly define the grain of the primary fact table. (e.g., "The grain of the fact table will be one row per unique review.").
    - Identify the source column(s that determine this grain (e.g., `review_id`).

5.  **Key Generation Strategy:**
    - **Dimensions:** State your plan to create a new surrogate key for every dimension table (e.g., "For the 'Product' dimension, I will create a new `product_key` as the surrogate primary key and keep the original `product_id` as a business key.").
    - **Facts:** State your plan for the fact table's keys, including its primary key and the foreign keys it will need to link to the dimensions.

6.  **SCD Strategy:**
    - State your plan for handling changes to dimension attributes. For this version, you must state: "All dimensions will use an SCD Type 1 (overwrite) strategy."

7.  **Self-Correction Review (MANDATORY):**
    - Before generating the JSON, explicitly answer the following questions to verify your plan:
        - "Does every dimension table in my plan include a new surrogate key column (e.g., `product_key`) AND the original natural key column (e.g., `product_id`)?"
        - "Does every single table (fact and dimension) in my plan include the two mandatory housekeeping columns: `load_date` and `source_file`?"
        - "Does every dimension table in my plan include the `scd_type: 'SCD1'` field?"
        - "Have I specified a precise, actionable transformation for every column, especially for dates and semantic types?"

# STEP 2: GENERATE THE STTM JSON
After you have completed and written out your Chain of Thought and Self-Correction Review, generate the final JSON output. The JSON must be a direct implementation of the decisions you made in your reasoning step.

## ARCHITECTURAL BLUEPRINT (MANDATORY JSON RULES)

### A. Housekeeping & Metadata (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
* **SCD Type:** For every dimension table in the `dimensions` list, you MUST include a field named `scd_type` and set its value to `"SCD1"`.
* **Audit Columns:** Every single target table (both fact and dimension) MUST include the following two housekeeping columns for auditability:
    - `load_date`: A timestamp indicating when the record was loaded. The transformation MUST be `current_timestamp()`.
    - `source_file`: The name of the source file for the record. The transformation MUST be `literal('{{ source_name }}')`.

### B. Key Generation Strategy:
* **Dimension Surrogate Keys (MANDATORY):** Every dimension table MUST have a new, system-generated surrogate primary key.
    - **Name:** `[dimension_name]_key` (e.g., `product_key`).
    - **Type:** `IntegerType()` or `LongType()`.
    - **Transformation:** `generate_surrogate_key`.
    - **Source Column:** For this transformation, the `source_column` MUST be the original natural key from the source data (e.g., `product_id`).
    - **JSON `primary_key` Field:** The `primary_key` field in the JSON for the dimension table MUST be populated with the name of this new surrogate key (e.g., `["product_key"]`).
* **Keep Natural Keys (MANDATORY):** The original business key from the source (e.g., `product_id`) MUST be included as a separate column in the dimension table. Its transformation should be `direct_map`.
* **Fact Foreign Keys:** Every foreign key in the fact table MUST be named after the dimension's surrogate key (e.g., `product_key`).
* **Fact Table Column Mapping (CRITICAL):** When listing columns for the fact table, map the natural keys with a `direct_map` transformation (e.g., source `product_id` to target `product_id`). **DO NOT** invent `lookup` transformations. The `foreign_keys` section of the STTM is the only place that defines the relationship to the dimension's surrogate key.

### C. Actionable Transformation Logic (The Playbook):
You must provide precise, testable transformation rules. Follow this playbook:
* **Dates:** If the semantic type is a `DATE`, the transformation MUST be `to_date(source_column, 'yyyy-MM-dd')`.
* **Timestamps:** If the semantic type is a `TIMESTAMP`, the transformation MUST be `to_timestamp(source_column, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')`.
* **String Standardization:** For all generic `TEXT` attributes in dimensions (e.g., names, categories), you MUST apply a `trim(upper(source_column))` transformation.
* **US Zip Codes:** If the semantic type is `US_ZIP_CODE`, the transformation MUST be `lpad(source_column, 5, '0')` and the target type MUST be `StringType()`.
* **US Phone Numbers:** If the semantic type is `US_PHONE_NUMBER`, the transformation MUST be `regexp_replace(source_column, '[^0-9]', '')` to strip all non-numeric characters.
* **Emails:** If the semantic type is `EMAIL_ADDRESS`, you MUST suggest a `validate_regex('^[^@]+@[^@]+\\.[^@]+$')` transformation.
* **Handling Nulls:** For numeric measures in fact tables, you MUST suggest a `coalesce(source_column, 0)` transformation.

## PERFECT DIMENSION EXAMPLE
To ensure you understand the final structure, here is an example of a perfect `dim_product` table definition. Your output for all dimension tables MUST follow this exact structure, including all specified fields and columns.
```json
{
  "source_name": "products.csv",
  "target_table_name": "dim_product",
  "table_type": "dimension",
  "primary_key": [
    "product_key"
  ],
  "scd_type": "SCD1",
  "columns": [
    {
      "source_column": "product_id",
      "target_column": "product_key",
      "target_type": "IntegerType()",
      "transformation_rule": "generate_surrogate_key",
      "description": "Surrogate primary key for the product dimension."
    },
    {
      "source_column": "product_id",
      "target_column": "product_id",
      "target_type": "StringType()",
      "transformation_rule": "direct_map",
      "description": "Natural (business) key from the source system."
    },
    {
      "source_column": "product_name",
      "target_column": "product_name",
      "target_type": "StringType()",
      "transformation_rule": "trim(upper(source_column))",
      "description": "Standardized product name."
    },
    {
      "source_column": null,
      "target_column": "load_date",
      "target_type": "TimestampType()",
      "transformation_rule": "current_timestamp()",
      "description": "Timestamp of when the record was loaded into the warehouse."
    },
    {
      "source_column": null,
      "target_column": "source_file",
      "target_type": "StringType()",
      "transformation_rule": "literal('products.csv')",
      "description": "The source file this record originated from."
    }
  ]
}

# TARGET JSON SCHEMA (STTM)
Your output must be a JSON object that strictly follows this Pydantic schema:
```json
{{ sttm_schema | tojson(indent=2) }}
